<p>We would like to introduce <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/anne-gordon/0/ab7/21b" target="_blank">Anne Gordon</a> to the Kinderloop family. Anne was trained as a lawyer, first at the public policy school at Princeton, and then at the University of Michigan for her JD. Â She spent a few years working in public service, including clerking on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeal, before coming up with the basic version of Kinderloop - as a mother of two girls under 4, she knew there had to be a better way for preschools to communicate with parents.</p>

<p>After a couple of months, she found the solution: a simple, teacher-friendly mobile communication platform. She was a finalist at AngelHack SF 2013 with the idea, but just as she was about to build it out, she stumbled upon Kinderloop. She was so impressed with both the team and the tech that she knew she wanted to join forces; the Kinderloop team was similarly impressed and felt the same. As the third member of the founding team focusing on business development, she brings an amazing wealth of US market knowledge to the Kinderloop family. Anne is thrilled about joining the team: &#8220;Kinderloop is a real passion for me, as I know it can improve the lives of parents, providers, and kids, all with a simple technology - I truly believe it can change the world.</p>
<p>Although Kinderloop and her family take up most of her time, she is also a fellow at UC-Berkeley, enjoys running around Lake Merritt, and singing (increasingly poorly). She has also lived and worked in over 30 countries, and looks forward to more opportunities to travel with the increasingly-international Kinderloop.</p>
