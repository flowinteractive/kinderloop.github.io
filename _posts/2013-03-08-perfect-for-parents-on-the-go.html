<p>We have noticed that parents are more actively participating in our program. This week alone, 5 different families have brought in items from home, based upon what we have been working on at group times.This is all via Kinderloop – some of it we have asked for and others parents have just done themselves.</p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<p>This would NEVER have happened before, even if I had emailed.</p>
<p>We are now going to start tagging the posts with ‘family input’ when this happens. Fantastic for when the ACO’s need to see how families are contributing to the program!</p>
