<p>The educators are finding the iPad minis really easy to use and kinderloop allows them more ‘eyes on’ time and less time reporting each day, they also use the iphone app in the evening if they have forgotten to post something.</p>
<h3><span>The numbers…</span></h3>
<p>~ 93 children, 15 educator<br/> ~ average 25 posts per day<br/> ~ <strong>1,343 posts</strong> viewed by parents<br/> ~ average <strong>saving $1000 per year</strong> on print<br/> ~ <em>saving <strong>4hrs per week</strong> in ‘off the floor’ time</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‘Just wanted to let you know that Kinderloop is going full steam ahead at our centre. The families are loving seeing the photos of their children each day. It is also helping to ‘settle’ the new mums and dads in to the centre – they feel more at ease seeing photos of their child happy and playing! Thank you for the quick implementation of our suggestions too!’ </em></p>
