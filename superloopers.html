            <p class="description">
                Having worked in licensed child care centres as a teacher, assistant Director and Supervisor I am very familiar with what is required in licensed care and will ensure that my home child care will reflect those same practices. I have also worked for CAS, the Ontario Early Years Center, Gymboree Play & Music, and for many years with children with special needs. I have collected many resources related to the development of children, and consider myself to be knowledgeable in the many wonderful events and resources that are available to parents in our community.
